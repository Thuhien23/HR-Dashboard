### Insights:
**Stable Retention Rate:**
The retention rate is high at nearly 90%, indicating good employee satisfaction overall. The relatively low turnover suggests that the majority of employees remain with the company for extended periods.

**Salary Correlation:**
A positive correlation between salary and retention implies that higher compensation contributes to employee retention, especially in strategic roles. This could be an opportunity to revisit salary structures in departments with lower retention.

**Age Group Focus:**
The largest workforce age group is between 40-49 years. Strategic initiatives focusing on succession planning or training for this group may be beneficial as they approach the later stages of their careers.

**Geographic Workforce Distribution:**
The concentration of employees in the U.S., followed by China and Brazil, suggests the company's major operations are centered in these regions. Understanding localized HR strategies and compensation could further improve retention in these regions.

**Ethnic Diversity:**
The dashboard reflects a relatively diverse workforce. To enhance this, further initiatives in underrepresented groups might be explored to balance the ethnic distribution even more.
